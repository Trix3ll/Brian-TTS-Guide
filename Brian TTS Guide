Cheering vs Donations
One advantage that cheering has over donations is that the max text limit is increased to 500 compared to the StreamElements’ page of 255. Having more text means you can spam more and increase the length of time that Brian has increased reading speed. 

Speed
Speed of TTS can be modified several different ways, each involving spamming characters at the end of your message. You can use any of these characters, each one will make your text faster. 
¨¨Ï¸          /// Pronounced “diaresis”
Ç⒄⒄     /// Pronounced “opening parenthesis 17 closing parenthesis”
¨¨¸¨¨¨¸     /// Pronounced “diaresis”
⒲          /// Pronounced “opening parenthesis w closing parenthesis”

There are probably other symbols you can use as well, but these are the ones that are most used. Additionally, any repeating number such as 7777 can be used as well. 

Using capitals, you can manipulate which sentences are fast, and which are slow. 

Examples: 

Hello. I. Am. Talking. Very. Slow. NOW I AM TALKING VERY FAST ¨¨¸¨¨¨¸
¨¨¸¨¨¨¸
¨¨¸¨¨¨¸
¨¨¸¨¨¨¸
¨¨¸¨¨¨¸

The more of these characters you put at the end of your message, the longer Brian will speak with a faster voice. Try to maximize the amount of these characters in your message. 





Useful Characters / SFX / Other
The full list of characters that Brian pronounces can be found here: https://gist.github.com/TETYYS/f1aa16b18fb619fc6c0f13ba4f9ae70d

Here are some useful ones and combinations of characters that I have found and you can use in your message.

ᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺᴺ!    /// The “printing” sound effect
ᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾᴾ  /// A special P that, when combined, makes an effect
⒲⒲⒲⒲⒲⒲    /// Opening parenthesis, W, closing parenthesis
ᴶ, ᵀ, and ⱽ    /// Combining these in different ways makes “beatboxing” sound
⑺               /// Opening parenthesis, seven, closing parenthesis
􃎜              /// Sounds like “poonk” but much faster
“􃎜􃍲”        /// Sounds like “dumdumdumdumdum” when copied
“􃎜A”        /// Sounds like “maymaymaymay” when copied multiple times
“􃎜M”       /// Hyperspeed “em” when copied multiple times (􃎜M􃎜M􃎜M􃎜M)
“􃉐􃉐􃉐􃉐􃉐􃉐”          /// “t” sound effect
“﹠”         /// Mini & symbol that sounds like a music beat when copied
“NG”  // Gulping sound (cooBruh)
“Guhm”    /// Another gulping sound
“yDRDRDRDR” /// Machine gun sound. To make longer, keep pasting “DR”
“yfths” or “yxths” /// Weird sounding. Not sure how to explain. 

Word Combining
You can combine words to make Brian sound more Pepega. 
Examples:
“xQc doesn’t know Pepega Clap” -> “Xqcdoesntknowpepegaclap”
“xQc you are 99.9% Pepega” -> “Xqcyouare99point9percentpepega”

Cursing Chat
(Courtesy of /u/empty_castle)
You can generate curses to use in the TTS by using this website: http://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/_latin

On the top drop down box, select “Don’t start with Lorem Ipsum” and click Generate. Copy and paste the first paragraph and do whatever you want with it. Combine words, add cedilla or diaresis, etc. Also double check that the donation won’t get filtered out by cmonBruh-able stuff and remove it if it’s there.
